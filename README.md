Welcome to Benchmarket!

We have inside of the repository a simple HTML CSS JS structure and it also includes magic.js which can be run with node.js to connect fhenix and galadriel. Inside the contracts folder are battleship.sol, IBenchmarket.sol, and groq.sol. Battleship enables the battleship game to be played on Fhenix it employs IBenchmarket which is the standard for gaming contracts within the Benchmarket ecosystem and groq.sol is for Galadriel to be able to have startChat(chatId, model) where model is the model we are playing against.
